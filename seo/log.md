# SEO run log

Semi-weekly runs per `seo/routine.md`. Newest entry at the bottom.
Run count matters: every fourth run does the wider sweep instead of
just the per-run checks.

## 2026-09-18 — run 1

**Shipped:** `blog/how-to-move-a-linear-accelerator` — first medical-cluster
item off the queue. 1,772 body words, 6 FAQ entries, 10 H2s, question-shaped.
Links to medical rigging, machinery removal, crane services, heavy-lift
rigging, the MRI post, the CT post and the relocation checklist. Queue item
flipped to done; 11 todo items remain, so no backfill needed yet.

**Verify:** `node build.js` full chain, all checks passed — city mesh 352/352,
67,226 internal links with 0 broken, 0 links to retired URLs, 0 duplicate
titles, 0 heavy-haul leakage, sitemap 643 URLs 0 bad, phone + department email
on 654/654 pages.

**Checks:**
- New URL returns 200 live (404 on first poll, 200 after the Pages deploy).
  `/services/mri-medical-equipment-rigging` and `/blog/how-to-move-an-mri-machine`
  both 200, neither a stub. `/services/heavy-haul` still serves its redirect stub.
- Post is in the live `sitemap.xml` and the live `llms.txt`.
- All three JSON-LD blocks parse on the live page: Article, BreadcrumbList,
  FAQPage with 6 entries. Quick-answer box rendered, canonical self-referencing.
- IndexNow: HTTP 200 accepted, 638 URLs.

**Fixed along the way:** `scripts/check-content.js` — the step-2 gate in the
routine — only ever looked in `content/services/`, so running it on a blog slug
errored out and no blog post had ever actually been gated. It now validates a
`content/blog-new/<slug>.js` module against the routine's own non-negotiables
(tldr 40-70 words, 4-6 FAQ entries, 1,200-2,000 body words, hero image exists,
relative links resolve) plus the same positioning lint as service pages.
Service-page checking is unchanged.

**Not done / needs Sam:**
- Google sitemap resubmit. `gsc-key.json` is still only on the old M2 machine,
  so `ping-search-engines.js` skipped the Google half. **Submit `sitemap.xml`
  by hand in the Search Console UI.** Copying that key over would close this
  out permanently.
- No Search Console data available to this run, so the positions 5-15 sweep and
  the city-page indexation rule are untouched. Both belong to run 4.
- Minor, cosmetic: `build-sitemap.js` derives `lastmod` from UTC, and runs
  happen in the early hours PKT, so a page built today gets yesterday's date.
  Harmless — noting it so it isn't chased later as a bug.

**Next run:** `how-to-move-an-x-ray-machine` (medical cluster).
**Run 4 is the wider sweep.**
